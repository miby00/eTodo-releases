# eTodo-releases
Prebuilt release packages for Linux, Mac and Windows and other files needed to build these packages.

The packages are built for the following architectures:

* Windows 7 32-bit (will probably work on a 64-bit machine aswell)
* Ubuntu 64-bit (will probably work on most debian package based distributions)
* Mac 64-bit

If the packages don't work for you build your own release using the eTodo repository.
